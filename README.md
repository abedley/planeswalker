# Planeswalker

A single-player game built on a subset of the Magic: The Gathering rules, written in plain
JavaScript (ES modules, no build step) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

So far the engine models the **turn structure** (phases and steps) and **priority**. The only
player action is **passing priority**.

- `index.html`: landing page
- `debug/`: engine debugger, which lets you play both sides, watch every event, and inspect state

## Running locally

ES modules have to be served over HTTP, so opening the files directly won't work:

```sh
npm run serve        # python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/debug/
npm test             # node --test (Node 18+)
```

## GitHub Pages

The site is served from the root of the `main` branch. To turn it on, go to
**Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, pick **Deploy from a branch**, then choose
`main` and `/ (root)`. The `.nojekyll` file makes Pages serve the files as they are.

## Engine architecture

```
           action events                          state + transition events
 controller ───────────────▶  Game (EventEmitter)  ───────────────────────────▶ UI / AI / logs
 (UI, AI)   ◀───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── (listeners)
                          state.validActions tells each controller what it may do
```

The `Game` emits events and also listens for them:

- **Output:** a `state` event every time the game stops to wait for input. Its payload is a full
  snapshot (a deep copy) that includes `validActions`, so a client can be built entirely from
  `state` events: show a button for each valid action and send it back unchanged.
- **Input:** `game.dispatch(action)`, or `game.listenTo(emitter)`, which dispatches every `action`
  event the emitter emits. An action dispatched from inside a listener is queued and runs once
  the current action has finished, so listeners never re-enter the engine.

```js
import { Game, AutoPassController } from './src/index.js';

const game = new Game({ players: [{ id: 'p1', name: 'You' }, { id: 'p2', name: 'Opponent' }] });

game.on('state', (state) => {
  console.log(state.turn, state.phase, state.step, state.priorityPlayerId, state.validActions);
});
new AutoPassController({ game, playerId: 'p2', delayMs: 300 }); // listens to state, emits action

game.start();
game.dispatch({ type: 'PASS_PRIORITY', playerId: 'p1' });
```

### Events

Every payload carries a `seq` number that increases for each event the game emits.

| Event | Payload | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gameStarted` | `players`, `startingPlayerId` | `start()` is called |
| `turnStarted` / `turnEnded` | `turn`, `activePlayerId` | turn boundaries |
| `phaseStarted` / `phaseEnded` | `phase`, `phaseName`, ... | phase boundaries |
| `stepStarted` / `stepEnded` | `step`, `stepName`, ... | step boundaries (main phases have no steps) |
| `stepSkipped` | `step`, `stepName`, ... | a step is skipped (see below) |
| `priorityGranted` | `playerId` | a player receives priority |
| `priorityPassed` | `playerId` | a player passes priority |
| `actionAccepted` / `actionRejected` | `action` (+ `reason`) | an action is processed |
| `state` | full snapshot incl. `validActions`, `version` | the game is waiting for input |

`game.onAny((name, payload) => ...)` receives every event.

### Rules implemented

- The turn structure follows CR 500–514: beginning (untap, upkeep, draw), precombat main, combat
  (beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, end of combat),
  postcombat main, and ending (end, cleanup).
- No player receives priority during untap or cleanup (502.4, 514.3).
- The active player receives priority at the start of every other step and main phase (117.3a).
  After a pass, the next player in turn order receives it (117.3d).
- When all players pass in succession with an empty stack, the step or phase ends (117.4, 500.2).
- The player who goes first skips the draw step of turn 1 (103.8a).
- Declare blockers and combat damage are skipped when no creatures attack (508.8). For now,
  nothing can attack.

The turn structure is defined as data in `src/engine/turnStructure.js`. Each step or main
phase records whether players get priority and can provide a `skip` rule.
